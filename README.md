Cross-platform CLI tool to create HTML5 boilerplates on the go.

By running the creation command (see 'Usage' below), a complete HTML5 project is placed for you that includes basic HTML, CSS (including the latest version of normalize.css) and JavaScript files for you to start coding directly without the hassle of having to redo those steps each time you're working on a new project.

## Installation
You can install it by running

```
npm install -g lazyend
```

## Usage
To create a new project simply run:

```
lazyend -c project-name
```

## Contribution
All contributions to the logic or the HTML5 code are welcome!
